<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, my name is Arya Utture! I am currently an undergraduate student 
   at Rutgers University - New Brunswick majoring in computer science with 
   a potential minor in data science through the School of Arts and Sciences.
</p>

<p>My interests include, but are not limited to: web development, software 
   development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I'm seeking 
   a summer internship in which I can apply the skills I have already gained/learned 
   into the industry and further improve my knowledge of the technical and software developing world.
